# Employee Statistics Case Study 📊

A case study on an Employee dataset using Python. This project focuses on descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It includes data exploration, visualization of employee ratings and compensation, and subsetting analysis to derive insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze employee-related data and extract insights using statistical and visualization techniques.  
The study includes:
- Loading and studying the dataset (size, features, datatypes).
- Understanding distributions of employee ratings and compensations.
- Subsetting the dataset based on thresholds for deeper analysis.
- Visualizing trends and relationships using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
